            <p>My name is Abbey Ledford and I am an Information Science Student at Michigan State University, I also recently declared a minor in sociology. In my free time I like to read, play video games, and write. I also have been doing theatre for 10+ years and consider music a huge part of my life. I was born in Flint, Michigan but moved to Waterford, Michigan when I was 11, which is in the Metro Detroit Area. I have 3 siblings all younger than me, 2 are in highschool and one is in her freshman year at Grand Valley State University. </p>
            <p>I am very passionate about technology and the influence of it on the general public, and hope that with my degree I can study the effects of increasing technology on development of the brain. I also think it is important that everyone is able to have access to technology, even individuals that are less important. Many people are able to find a strong sense of community online, specifically LGBTQ+ youth and it is important to make these connections, even moreso if you do not live in an area where it is readily available.</p>
